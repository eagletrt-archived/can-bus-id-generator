# Can-bus-id-generator

This software was developed from E-agleTRT in order to generate CAN-BUS IDs. In order to find optimezed IDs for Fenice (season 2019-2020) architecture the software is based on masks, filters and messages priority. This software generates automatically other code usable in different devices like STM32F4, STM32F7, Raspberry and others. Due to the the fact the architecture is composed by very different devices, a common file is needed in order to make all of them communicating with each others.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This software was implemented with `QTCreator` in `C++` for feature graphic implementations (writing the .json files could be a mass the first times).

### Installing

The following steps give you the possibility to run and modify the code in order to implement for your requirements.

Get QTCreator software from:
```
https://www.qt.io/
```

and follow the installation steps from the website guide: 

```

```

Now we are ready for coding.
